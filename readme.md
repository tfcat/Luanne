a series of small apps that accommodate a very simple machine learning library i made from scratch in lua for an extended project qualification while doing a-levels - the focus was on how they work primitively, and was closer to a mathematical research project than a compsci project.

these included the library itself, a visualiser made in love2d, a bunch of apps for translating images into unitary vectors, and a few dataset fetchers (just downloaded a ton of poetry from websites)

part of the project was to also present this technology and explain it to a non-technical audience, in which i think i did successfully as maximum marks were awarded for this project.

*While functional, this isn't practical for uses beyond this practice project.* This is here only to use as an example of the from-scratch programming of a simple perceptron in lua. Thank you!
